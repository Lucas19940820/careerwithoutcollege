			 Let us first start by stating that our programs are both challenging and rewarding to complete. All of our programs have been specifically designed with you and the public's safety in mind. Our programs emphasize hands‐on learning as the primary vehicle to build your skills as a Professional Truck Tractor‐Trailer Driver. Make no mistake that proficiency, competence and proper driver safety can only be attained with generous preparation time. Our very effective training system provides our students with efficient training hours while limiting the actual physical attendance to only 12 Months.
			 The classroom hours are very efficiently determined by need. Remember, your time here is limited and important. "Behind‐the‐wheel" training time should not be taken up studying a lot of "filler" classroom subjects. The CW College program is ideally designed for the busy, on‐the‐go student of the new millennium.
			 We will be in constant contact with trucking industry personnel who advise and help us maximize the training content and quality thus providing our graduates an opportunity for success. Since inception, our main business will be training Professional Truck  Drivers.
			 CW College is an eligible training provider for transport and Logistics Company. 
             What all this means to you is: VALUE AND EMPLOYER RECOGNITION. We offer up to date programs with a very competitive tuition that is rarely met by any other institution. I'm sure you will see the value in the training we offer you. So welcome to CW College, future graduates. We look forward to working with you and helping you achieve your career goals.
